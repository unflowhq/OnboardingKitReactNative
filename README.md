# Onboardingkit

OnboardingKit is a set of free to use templates you can throw into your apps to help you skip a couple steps on your journey to best-in-class.

They're a companion to our [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1197544767192716804) which contains the design for each of our flows.

## About

![MinimalOnboarding](/github/MinimalOnboarding.png)

Included is the first template we built in React Native which is a Minimal Onboarding flow. Optimized to work on both iOS and Android. A stunning welcome flow that leans heavily on clean, simple illustrations. It skips all the boring stuff and gets right to collecting the phone number, performing verification, and getting them into the product. If your product speaks for itself, this is for you.

Feel free to take what you need from the template and integrate it into your own app, just make sure to swap out the placeholder text and authentication service methods.
